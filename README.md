# Analysing An Online Restaurant
Applying data science on a real world business case.

## Background
This project was completed as part a capstone project for the Data Science Immersive course I enrolled myself in. It is a chance to put all I've learnt in 12 weeks into a project of my choice that would reflect my understanding of the topics.

## Data
Source: The data was very kindly given to me by a Singapore online restaurant. 
As an NDA was signed, parts of the information are censored. Please reach out to me at els.pse+gh@gmail.com if you have any questions or would like to offer feedback and comments!

## Problem Statement
A wealth of transaction data is collected by the restaurant. What are some outcomes that could be reaped from data analysis?
